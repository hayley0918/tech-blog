            "postP1": "OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency. Even when using microservices, developers should continue to apply the principles of OOP. The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise often known as data modeling. Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages.",

            "postP1": "There’s a high chance you came across the term “REST API” if you’ve thought about getting data from another source on the internet, such as Twitter or Github. But what is a REST API? What can it do for you? How do you use it? Let’s say you’re trying to find videos about Batman on Youtube. You open up Youtube, type “Batman” into a search field, hit enter, and you see a list of videos about Batman. A REST API works in a similar way. You search for something, and you get a list of results back from the service you’re requesting from. An API is an application programming interface. It is a set of rules that allow programs to talk to each other. The developer creates the API on the server and allows the client to talk to it. REST determines how the API looks like. It stands for “Representational State Transfer”. It is a set of rules that developers follow when they create their API. One of these rules states that you should be able to get a piece of data (called a resource) when you link to a specific URL. Each URL is called a request while the data sent back to you is called a response.",
            "postP2": "It’s important to know that a request is made up of four things: The endpoint, The method, The headers, The data (or body). The endpoint (or route) is the url you request for. The root-endpoint is the starting point of the API you’re requesting from. The root-endpoint of Github’s API is https://api.github.com while the root-endpoint Twitter’s API is https://api.twitter.com. The path determines the resource you’re requesting for.",
            "postP3": "A RESTful API is an application program interface (API) that uses HTTP requests to GET, PUT, POST and DELETE data.A RESTful API -- also referred to as a RESTful web service or REST API -- is based on representational state transfer (REST), an architectural style and approach to communications often used in web services development. REST technology is generally preferred over the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, making it more suitable for efficient internet usage."

This is opposed to software development that allows code to be added that is not proven to meet requirements. 1. Add a test, 2. Run all tests and see if the new test fails, 3. Write the code, 4. Run tests, 5. Refactor code, Repeat",
            "postP2": "Test-Driven Development starts with designing and developing tests for every small functionality of an application. TDD instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed. This avoids duplication of code. The full form of TDD is Test-driven development. The simple concept of TDD is to write and correct the failed tests before writing new code (before development). This helps to avoid duplication of code as we write a small amount of code at a time in order to pass tests. Test-Driven development is a process of developing and running automated test before actual development of the application.",

Better Designed, cleaner and more extensible code, Confidence to Refactor Summary: It is a process of modifying the code in order to pass a test designed previously. It more emphasis on production code rather than test case design. Test-driven development is a process of modifying the code in order to pass a test designed previously. TDD includes refactoring a code i.e. changing/adding some amount of code to the existing code without affecting the behavior of the code. TDD when used, the code becomes clearer and simple to understand."

            "postP1": "React JS is a JavaScript library used in web development to build interactive elements on websites. React is created by Facebook and specializes in helping developers build user interfaces, or UIs. In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app. Before React JS, developers were stuck building UIs by hand with “vanilla JavaScript” or with less UI-focused React predecessors like jQuery. That meant longer development times and plenty of opportunities for errors and bugs. So, in 2011, Facebook engineer Jordan Walke created React JS specifically to improve UI development.", 
            "postP2": "React components implement a render() method that takes input data and returns what to display. This example uses an XML-like syntax called JSX. Input data that is passed into the component can be accessed by render() via this.props.",
            "postP3": "Declarative: React makes it painless to create interactive UIs. Design simple views for each state in your application, and React will efficiently update and render just the right components when your data changes. Declarative views make your code more predictable and easier to debug. Component-Based: Build encapsulated components that manage their own state, then compose them to make complex UIs. Since component logic is written in JavaScript instead of templates, you can easily pass rich data through your app and keep state out of the DOM."

            "postP1": "Ajax is short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, which refers to a set of web development techniques rather than an actual programming language. Although X in Ajax stands for XML, JSON is used more than XML nowadays because of its many advantages such as being lighter and a part of JavaScript. Both JSON and XML are used for packaging information in the Ajax model. Ajax however, is widely used in client side programming to allow for data to be sent and received to and from a database / server. What's special about using Ajax programming is that you can exchange data in the background without actually disturbing the user experience. This method is extremely useful both for website performance and usability. Since asynchronous loading is non-render blocking, it will allow your page's HTML to continue parsing even if it encounters a script tag. From a usability standpoint, visitors can benefit from seeing certain information generated without having to reload the page.",

            "blogText": "OOP focuses on the objects that developers want to manipulate rather than the logic required to manipulate them. This approach to programming is well-suited for programs that are large, complex and actively updated or maintained. Additional benefits of OOP include code reusability, scalability and efficiency. Even when using microservices, developers should continue to apply the principles of OOP. The first step in OOP is to collect all of the objects a programmer wants to manipulate and identify how they relate to each other -- an exercise often known as data modeling. Once an object is known, it is labeled with a class of objects that defines the kind of data it contains and any logic sequences that can manipulate it. Each distinct logic sequence is known as a method. Objects can communicate with well-defined interfaces called messages."

REST technology is generally preferred over the more robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, making it more suitable for efficient internet usage."

Run tests, 5. Refactor code, Repeat"

React is a JavaScript library that specializes in helping developers build user interfaces, or UIs. In terms of websites and web applications, UIs are the collection of on-screen menus, search bars, buttons, and anything else someone interacts with to USE a website or app. Before React JS, developers were stuck building UIs by hand with “vanilla JavaScript” (developer speak for the raw JavaScript language on its own) or with less UI-focused React predecessors like jQuery. That meant longer development times and plenty of opportunities for errors and bugs. So, in 2011, Facebook engineer Jordan Walke created React JS specifically to improve UI development."

            "blogText": "Ajax is short for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, which refers to a set of web development techniques rather than an actual programming language. Ajax however, is widely used in client side programming (e.g. JavaScript) to allow for data to be sent and received to and from a database / server. What's special about using Ajax programming is that you can exchange data in the background without actually disturbing the user experience. This method is extremely useful both for website performance and usability. Since asynchronous loading is non-render blocking, it will allow your page's HTML to continue parsing even if it encounters a script tag. From a usability standpoint, visitors can benefit from seeing certain information generated without having to reload the page."
